# Nelson-Rules-functions-on-python-
Nelson rules are a method in process control of determining if some measured variable is out of control (unpredictable versus consistent). (Wikipedia).
These are simple functions to alert if some of this rules is present on a data array.
Sorry for the ugly code, it works for me (my purpose)..
